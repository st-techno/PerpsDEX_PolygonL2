## Key optimizations for Polygon L2:

Struct Packing: Uses fixed-size types (uint128, int128) for efficient storage

Batch Readiness: Position management compatible with future batch processing

Gas-Efficient Storage: Uses mappings instead of arrays where possible

Oracle Optimization: Chainlink price feed with staleness check

Funding Rate Calculation: Time-based update trigger with imbalance ratio

Memory Calculations: Uses memory for temporary position data

Liquidation Incentives: 10% liquidation fee to encourage keepers

Immutable Variables: Critical addresses marked immutable for gas savings

This implementation follows Polygon-specific best practices from the search results, including:

Gas-efficient storage patterns

Batch-compatible operations

Layer-2 optimized error handling

Efficient numeric types

Modular funding rate mechanism

## Additional Key Features:

Access Control: Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControlUpgradeable for granular admin/keeper roles.

Circuit Breaker: Pausable contract with admin-only emergency stop and resume, as recommended for robust L2 DEXs.

Logging: Emits events for major actions (open/close/liquidate/upgrade/circuit breaker).

Polygon Gas Station Network: Supports meta-transactions via a trusted forwarder for gasless user experience.

Proxy Upgradability: Implements UUPS upgrade pattern for safe logic upgrades.

This code is production-grade, modular, and follows Polygon L2 and Solidity best practices for security and maintainability.
